I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like
Makin' good conversation
I gotta handle you just right
You know what I mean

I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There's nothin' left to talk about
Unless, it's horizontally

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk


I've been patient, I've been good
Tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard, this holdin' back
You know what I mean

I'm sure you'll understand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know, that you're bringin' out the animal in me

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical, let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

Let's get animal, animal
I wanna get animal, let's get into animal
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk



Let me hear your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
